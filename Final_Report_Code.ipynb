    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a reflection of a nation's dedication to the overall health and happiness of its population and is therefore an essential component of any nation's system of healthcare. In the United States of America, the cost of medical treatment has, for a very long time, been a major source of public anxiety, debate, and investigation. The purpose of this project report is to shed light on the complexities of a system that influences the life of every American by delving into the complexities of national spending on healthcare goods and services within the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The healthcare system in the United States is one of the most advanced and extensive in the world. It is distinguished by the wide variety of healthcare providers, funding mechanisms, and rules that are in place. The manner in which resources are distributed and the magnitude of expenditures made in this industry have significant bearing on the nation's overall economic security, the state of public health, and the distribution of wealth. Not only is it vital for policymakers to understand the dynamics of healthcare spending, but it is also essential for healthcare professionals, researchers, and the general public to have this understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Aims and Purposes\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is an outline of the overarching goals for this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To conduct an in-depth study on the patterns that have emerged in recent years regarding national spending on healthcare products and services in the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To identify the primary drivers, difficulties, and other factors that have an impact on the rise and distribution of healthcare expenditures.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To evaluate the influence that spending on healthcare has on the availability of medical care, the results of medical treatment, and the economy as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "This project report contains an in-depth analysis of how much money is spent on healthcare in the United States. The analysis covers a wide range of topics, including but not limited to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Breaking down expenses: analysing how money is spent on different aspects of healthcare, such as hospital care, physician services, medications, and public health efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Socioeconomic factors: the investigation of the relationship between healthcare spending and socioeconomic indicators such as income, insurance coverage, and discrepancies in access to care.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Discussion of important healthcare policies and reforms, as well as the consequences these policies and reforms have on spending patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to accomplish these goals, we utilised a methodical approach that included the gathering of data from reliable sources, the conduct of statistical analysis, and the perusal of a substantial amount of previous research. We considered the information provided by the Centres for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the National Health Expenditure Accounts (NHEA), and a number of other reliable sources. In addition, case studies and interviews with subject matter experts gave invaluable qualitative insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Significance\n",
    "\n",
    "The significance of this research extends far beyond the benefit it provides to academics and policymakers. For the purpose of making educated decisions, influencing healthcare policy, and, ultimately, enhancing the health and well-being of the American people, it is vital to have a comprehensive grasp of national spending on healthcare. We have high hopes that the insights that have been offered in this research will make a meaningful contribution to the discussions that are now taking place around healthcare reform, accessibility, and sustainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## edit *Details Regarding the Organisation of the Report*\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following chapters of this study, we are going to go further into the specifics of our analysis and findings. In Chapter 2, we investigate the historical tendencies in healthcare expenditure, and in Chapter 3, we investigate the driving variables that are behind these tendencies. The influence of spending on healthcare outcomes is the topic of discussion in Chapter 4, while the policy landscape is analysed in Chapter 5. In the last chapter, we share our findings, along with any recommendations we have based on our investigation."

    "## Dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "This figure provides a rough approximation of the overall sum of money spent on providing medical care each year. The major portion of the funds is allocated to the provision of healthcare services to various individuals. In addition to this, spending goes towards the management of healthcare programmes and private insurance plans, the construction of hospitals and clinics, the acquisition of necessary equipment, the promotion of public health, and the conduct of research in the field of medicine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quite a few distinct programmes are responsible for channelling the money that goes into healthcare expenditures. There are private health insurance plans, the money for which comes from the premiums paid by individual Americans as well as the employers of those individuals. In addition, there are government programmes that get funding on all three levels: federal, state, and municipal. In addition, there are subcategories such as school or worksite healthcare, which includes care provided by the school nurse, health screenings financed by the employer, and other on-site medical services.\n",

    "## Data Cleansing\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this data cleansing report is to document the key steps and transformations applied to the raw dataset, which was in CSV format. These steps include transposing the data, organizing categorical columns, renaming columns, and dropping duplicate columns, with the goal of preparing the data for further analysis and modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 1: Transposing the Data\n",
    "- *Description*: In order to facilitate analysis and visualisation, the original dataset was transposed by swapping rows and                    columns.\n",
    "- *Rationale*: The data can be presented in a more logical and systematic fashion by transposing it.\n",
    "- *Procedure*: We implemented `Microsoft Excel` to perform the first cleansing and transposition of the dataset.\n",
    "- *Result*: The transposed dataset is saved as `national_spending_on_healthcare_goods_and_services_usafacts_transposemain.xlsx` .\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 2: Organizing Categorical Columns\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Description*: Categorical columns in the dataset were organized to group and label them consistently.\n",
    "- *Rationale*: Organizing categorical columns simplifies data exploration and ensures a clear understanding of variable categories.\n",
    "- *Procedure*: We reviewed the categorical columns and applied consistent labeling and grouping.\n",
    "- *Result*: Categorical columns are now organized as per the predefined criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 3: Renaming the Columns*\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Description*: Column names were updated to provide more descriptive and meaningful labels.\n",
    "- *Rationale*: Clear and informative column names improve data readability and comprehension.\n",
    "- *Procedure*: We reviewed and modified column names to reflect the information they represent.\n",
    "- *Result*: Column names are now updated and more informative.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 4: Dropping Duplicate Columns\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Description*: Duplicate columns in the dataset were identified and removed.\n",
    "- *Rationale*: Duplicate columns add redundancy and can lead to inaccuracies in analysis.\n",
    "- *Procedure*: We identified duplicate columns by comparing column names and content.\n",
    "- *Result*: Duplicate columns have been successfully dropped from the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The data cleaning process has been completed successfully, and the dataset is now in a more structured, organized, and suitable format for further analysis and modeling. The transposed data, organized categorical columns, renamed columns, and removed duplicate columns enhance the dataset's quality and usability.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "The cleaned dataset will be used for visualizations and further analysis and insights will be derived from this cleaned dataset to support the project objectives.\n",
    "This data cleaning report provides a clear overview of the steps taken to clean the data, along with the rationale for each step and the resulting improvements in data quality. It also outlines the next steps in the data analysis process.\n"
